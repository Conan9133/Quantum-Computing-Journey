# 🌍 Applications and Examples

This section will explore **practical applications** of quantum computing and showcase real-world-inspired quantum programs.

## 🎯 Planned Examples

- Solving systems of equations
- Quantum finance examples
- Optimization problems with VQE/QAOA
- Machine learning basics (e.g., quantum classifiers)
- Running circuits on real IBM quantum hardware

## 📌 Status

🚧 This section is under construction. Notebooks and use-cases will be added soon.

## 💡 How This Will Be Used

This part will serve as a bridge between learning algorithms and applying them to solve problems or model systems.
