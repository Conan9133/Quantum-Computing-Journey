# Quantum Computing Journey 🧠⚛️

This is a personal learning repository where I document my progress in quantum computing — starting from fundamentals to implementing real quantum algorithms using Qiskit.

## Structure
- `basics/`: Notebooks for fundamental quantum computing concepts
- `algorithms/`: Implementation of well-known quantum algorithms
- `qiskit_playground/`: Experimenting with full Qiskit programs
- `learning_notes/`: My study notes and markdown summaries
- `references/`: Useful learning resources and citations

## Tools
- Qiskit
- Python 3.x
- JupyterLab
