# Quantum Computing Journey 🧠⚛️

This is a personal learning repository where I document my progress in quantum computing — starting from fundamentals to implementing real quantum algorithms using Qiskit.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `1_basics_and_qiskit_workflow/`: Foundational concepts, Qiskit basics, gates, measurements.
- `2_algorithms_from_scratch/`: Manual construction of QFT, QPE, HHL, VQLS and others.
- `3_algorithms_using_libraries/`: Implementations using Qiskit’s built-in modules.
- `4_applications_and_examples/`: Real-world or illustrative projects like quantum teleportation, QRNG, etc.
- `learning_notes/`: Markdown summaries, concept dumps, references, and TODOs.


## Tools
- Qiskit
- Python 3.x
- JupyterLab
