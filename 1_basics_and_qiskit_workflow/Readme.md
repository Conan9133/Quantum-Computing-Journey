# ⚙️ Qiskit Workflow Basics

This folder walks through the **end-to-end workflow in Qiskit** — from translating a quantum computing problem into a circuit, all the way to executing it on simulators or real quantum hardware, and analyzing the results.

This breakdown is designed to give a realistic and modular understanding of how real quantum programs are developed using Qiskit.

## 🧭 Qiskit Programming Flow

The canonical workflow you’ll follow across all subfolders is:

1. 🎯 **Map the Problem to a Quantum Circuit**
2. 🔧 **Transpile and Optimize the Circuit**
3. 🐞 **Debug and Validate the Circuit**
4. 🚀 **Execute on a Quantum Computer or Simulator**
5. 📊 **Post-process and Visualize the Results**

Each of these steps has its own dedicated subfolder in this directory.
