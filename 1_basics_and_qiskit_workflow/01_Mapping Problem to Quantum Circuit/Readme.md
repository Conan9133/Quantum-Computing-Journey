# 01 - Mapping Problems to Quantum Circuits

This folder contains examples and notes on how to map different types of problems into quantum circuits using Qiskit. This is the first and foundational step in the Qiskit workflow: formulating a problem in a way that can be implemented on a quantum computer. Formulating a circuit depends on the specific problem, so we focus more on creating circuits and taking measurements.

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- Understand the problem-to-circuit translation process
- Learn how classical inputs are encoded into qubits
- Explore common quantum circuit building blocks
- Gain intuition for designing meaningful circuits for algorithms
