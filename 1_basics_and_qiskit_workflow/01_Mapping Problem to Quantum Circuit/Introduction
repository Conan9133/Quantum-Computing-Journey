In this section, we provide an introduction to circuits and operators modules in Qiskit for building Quantum circuits.

## Circuits module

Qiskit has libraries of popular circuits which can be used as building blocks for your programs. Some of the important cirucits are as follows:

1. Standard gates: Circuits were built using standard quantum gates such as UGate, and others are multi-qubit gates that build from single and two qubit gates.

2. N-local Circuits: These circuits uses alternate layers of single-qubit rotation gates with layers of multi-qubit entangling gates.

Uses: Ansatzs in Variational algorithms

3. Data-encoding circuits: These cirucits encode the data onto quantum states for processing by quantum machine learning algorithms. Some of the circuits under this case are 
  a. Amplitude encoding
  b. Basis encoding
  c. Angle encoding

4. Time-evolution circuits: These circuits simulate a quantum state evolving in time. 
Uses: investigate physical effects such as heat transfer or phase transitions in a system, chemistry problems, QAOA algorithm

5. Benchmarking and complexity-theory circuits: Benchmarking circuits explores a sense of how well our hardware is actually working.
Complexity-theory circuits helps us understand how difficulty of the problems we want to solve are.

6. Arthimetic Circuits: Arithmetic circuits are the ones that do the arthimetic operations such as adding integers and bit-wise operations.
Ex: Adder circuits

##Operators Module
In qiskit, one can also create quantum circuits using operators module. Operators represents a math object: a unitary matrix. Quantum Operators are represented using classes. Some of the important classes are 

1. SparsePauliOp class: 
It represents a linear combination of Pauli strings.

2. Pauli class:
Pauli class represents a single Pauli string ({I, X, Y, Z}) with an optional phase coefficient from set { , i, -, -i }.

3. Operator Class:
Operator class represents a general linear operator.
